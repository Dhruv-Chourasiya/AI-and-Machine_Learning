# Python, AI & Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning journey into *Python, **Artificial Intelligence (AI), and **Machine Learning (ML)*! This repository is a reflection of my progress, practice, and projects as I explore the world of programming and intelligent systems.

## Day 1 & 2 Progress

I have just started my journey and completed the following topics in Python:

### ✅ Python Basics:
- *Hello World Program*
- *Taking User Input*
- *Data Types & Type Casting*
- *Basic Operations (Arithmetic, Logical, etc.)*

### ✅ String Operations:
- *Creating and Using Strings*
- *String Slicing*
- **String Methods (e.g., .upper(), .lower(), .replace(), etc.)**

### ✅ Control Flow:
- *if-else Statements*
- *for Loops*
- *while Loops*
- *match-case Statements (Python 3.10+)*
- *break & continue Keywords*

### ✅ Functions:
- *Defining and Calling Functions*
- *Parameters & Return Values*

## Day 3 Progress

Today's focus was on diving deeper into Python programming. Here's what I covered:

### ✅ Functions (Continued):
- *Function Parameters & Return Types*
- *Function Scope & Lifetime*
- *Recursive Functions*
- *Docstrings for Documentation*

### ✅ Data Structures:
- **Lists**
  - *Creating & Accessing Lists*
  - *List Methods (append, remove, insert, sort, reverse, etc.)*
- **Tuples**
  - *Tuple Creation & Access*
  - *Tuple Methods*

### ✅ Python Strings:
